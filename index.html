Customers expect transparency <em>and</em> clarity.</p>

          <h2>Clarity is good business.</h2>

          <p>When customers are informed and trust a brand, they are more likely to spend money. A recent study by the <a href="#">Harvard Business Review</a> makes it clear: Trust and loyalty are directly correlated with increased profits &mdash; by as much as 95 percent.

          <p>Consumers want to <em>trust</em> you and <em>reward</em> you for it.</p>
