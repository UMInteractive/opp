          <h2>Every relationship is built on trust.</h2>

          <p>Consumers understand personal data is used for legitimate reasons, and in most cases, they support providing it. Brands build more robust services and improve processes which benefit everyone. However, privacy policy legalese is not enough to build good relationships. Customers expect transparency <em>and</em> clarity.</p>

          <h2>Clarity is good business.</h2>
          
          <p>Open Privacy Policy imagines a world where everyone upholds a culture of honesty and transparency. It’s not right to bury your intentions in a long legal document. Consumers want to be informed. When they are, they trust the brand and are more likely to spend money.</p>

        <p>It’s no surprise that trust and loyalty translate to increased retention. A recent study by the <a href="#">Harvard Business Review</a> makes it clear: trust and loyalty are directly correlated with increased profits—by as much as 95%.</p> 

        <p>Consumers not only want to trust you, they’ll reward you for it. Clarity is better for everyone.</p>
